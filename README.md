# Thought for a while

Thought for a while is a public, self-directed program exploring how AI, XR, robotics, genomics, and neurotechnology can be orchestrated to improve care, reduce suffering, and expand healthy longevity.

This repository is the source of truth for the curriculum, weekly build log, projects, and evaluation standards.

## Live hub (GitHub Pages)
- Hub: https://thoughtforawhile-labs.github.io

## What’s inside
- `/docs/syllabus/` — 7 courses (12 weeks each): objectives, readings, assignments
- `/docs/week-by-week/` — weekly build log and shipped artifacts
- `/docs/assignments/` — rubrics, templates, and project requirements
- `/docs/projects/` — PsychSync, MedPal, benchmarks, capstones
- `/docs/ethics/` — disclaimers, safety policy, data governance
- `/docs/validation/` — reproducibility standards and evaluation methods

## Core projects
- **PsychSync** — multi-agent acute mental health decision support (human-in-the-loop, safety-first)
- **MedPal** — AI patient navigator for chronic care / oncology
- **Benchmarks & tooling** — evaluation suites for high-stakes clinical tasks under ambiguity

## Safety and scope (friendly but serious)
- Not medical advice. Educational and research purposes only.
- No patient-identifying data in public repositories.
- Prototypes here are not validated clinical tools and must not be used for real patient decisions.
- Any clinical collaboration will be governance-first (REB/IRB if needed, data agreements, approved handling).

## How to follow along
Links to GitHub Pages, Medium, LinkedIn, and X are maintained on the hub.
