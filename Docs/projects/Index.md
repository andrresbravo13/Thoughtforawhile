# Projects

Thoughtforawhile Labs organizes work into a small number of “programs” with clear deliverables, evaluation methods, and safety boundaries.

## Active programs
- **PsychSync** — multi-agent acute mental health decision support (human-in-the-loop)
- **MedPal** — patient navigation and care pathway support (chronic care / oncology)
- **Benchmarks & tooling** — evaluation suites for high-stakes clinical tasks
- **Capstone Command Center** — global threats + medical singularity synthesis

## What makes a project “real” here
Every project must have:
1) a **Project Proposal** (scope, users, success metrics)
2) a **Safety Case** (failure modes, guardrails, stop conditions)
3) a **Dataset Card** (source, license, bias notes)
4) a **Model Card** (intended use, limitations, evaluation)
5) a reproducible artifact (demo or benchmark run)
