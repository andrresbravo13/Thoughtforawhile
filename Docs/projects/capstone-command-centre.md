# Capstone: Command Centre

## Purpose
A systems-level synthesis and simulation environment for “Biomedical Singularity” threats:
- engineered pandemics / biological threats
- antimicrobial resistance
- mental health collapse dynamics
- immunosenescence / biological decay
- fertility decline

## Format
- A public whitepaper (systems map + interventions)
- A simulation prototype (simple, transparent models first)
- A decision-playbook: what to do when data is ambiguous and stakes are high

## Deliverables
- Systems map + causal assumptions
- Simulation with documented parameters
- Evaluation: sensitivity analyses + failure modes
- Stakeholder memo: what’s actionable now vs speculative
