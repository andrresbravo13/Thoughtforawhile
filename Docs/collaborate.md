# Collaborate

If you're a clinician, researcher, engineer, operator, or organization working near these problems, I’d love thoughtful feedback.

This program is optimized for **low-friction collaboration**: short, specific asks that respect your time.

---

## Collaboration menu (pick one)
### A) 15-minute monthly feedback
- You review one artifact (demo, write-up, benchmark result)
- You give 3–5 bullet points: what matters, what’s missing, what’s risky

### B) Dataset / benchmark pointers
- Recommend high-quality public datasets or evaluation standards
- Suggest what “good performance” means in real workflows

### C) Clinical workflow reality-check
- Identify failure modes and adoption blockers
- Suggest what should be escalated to a human and when

### D) Governance-approved collaboration (when appropriate)
- Retrospective studies or formal evaluations via institutional pathways
- Only with proper approvals and data agreements

## What I send you (so it’s easy)
When I ask for feedback, you’ll get:
- a 1-page brief (what the artifact is + what I want feedback on)
- a link to the artifact
- a clear time request (e.g., “10 minutes”)

---

## What I do with feedback
- I document the feedback (with permission) on **Validation → External Feedback**
- I incorporate changes and record them in the **Changelog**
- I avoid attributing quotes unless explicitly approved
