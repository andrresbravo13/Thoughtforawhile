# Ethics & Safety

I’m building in public, but I’m not building recklessly.

This page explains how Thoughtforawhile Labs approaches safety, privacy, and responsible communication—especially because the topics here touch clinical care, mental health, and high-stakes decision-making.

## Principles
- **People first**: human wellbeing > novelty
- **Human-in-the-loop by default**: AI supports judgment; humans remain responsible
- **Evidence over vibes**: claims require evaluation
- **Transparency**: limitations, failure modes, and uncertainty are documented
- **Governance matters**: real clinical work requires proper approvals and agreements
