# Biosecurity & Misuse

Some topics in biomedical science can be misused.

## Approach
- I focus on defensive, safety-first framing
- I avoid publishing operational details that increase misuse risk
- I emphasize governance, oversight, and responsible communication

## Boundaries
- No step-by-step instructions that enable harmful biological activity
- No guidance for evasion or wrongdoing
- No claims about capabilities that aren’t evaluated

If there’s uncertainty about risk, I default to caution.
