# Safety Policy (Non-negotiables)

## I will not
- Deploy autonomous clinical decision systems for real patient care
- Use or solicit private patient data outside approved governance
- Present unvalidated models as clinically reliable
- Hide limitations or failure modes
- Publish content that materially increases harm risk (including misuse or biosecurity-relevant instructions)

## I will
- Design for **human oversight**, safe failure modes, and clear uncertainty reporting
- Maintain an audit trail (dataset cards, model cards, experiment logs)
- Prefer conservative claims and transparent limitations
- Build evaluation harnesses that test “real” edge cases, not just happy paths
- Treat trust as something to earn through evidence and interface design
