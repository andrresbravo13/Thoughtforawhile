# Disclaimers (Friendly, but serious)

## Not medical advice
Everything here is for education and research. Nothing on this site is medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment guidance. If you need medical support, please talk to a licensed professional.

## Prototypes are not clinical tools
Any models, agents, or apps shown here are experimental prototypes. They are not validated for clinical use and should not be used to make real patient decisions.

## No patient-identifying data
I don’t publish or process patient-identifying information (PHI) in public repositories. If I collaborate with a clinical institution, it will be under appropriate governance (REB/IRB if needed) and approved data handling procedures.

## Performance claims are earned
I’ll only make performance claims that are backed by documented evaluation. When results are preliminary, I’ll say so clearly and highlight limitations.
