# Roadmap

A structured plan with room for iteration. Timeboxes are approximate and will be updated as the program progresses.

## Phases

| Phase | Timebox | Focus | Public artifacts |
|---|---:|---|---|
| 0. Setup | 2 weeks | Hub, templates, standards, baseline projects | Hub live, ethics pages, agenda |
| 1. Foundations | 12–24 weeks | Course 1–2 + first benchmark | 2 course write-ups, 1 benchmark, 1 demo repo |
| 2. Discovery + Genomics | 24–48 weeks | Course 3 + 5 | 1 discovery pipeline, 1 genomics pipeline, translational memo |
| 3. Agentic Systems | 48–60 weeks | Course 4 | PsychSync v1 + evaluation harness + safety case |
| 4. Global Threats Capstone | 60–72 weeks | Course 6 | “Command Center” whitepaper + simulation results |
| 5. Neurotech | 72–84 weeks | Course 7 | BCI pipeline + poster-ready write-up |

## Operating cadence
- Commitment: **1–1.5 hours/day**
- Output: **weekly shipped artifact**
- Quality: citations, reproducibility, honest limitations
- Safety: no PHI, no clinical deployment, governance-first collaborations
