# Thoughtforawhile

A public, self-directed program exploring how AI, XR, robotics, genomics, and neurotechnology can be orchestrated to improve care, reduce suffering, and expand healthy longevity.

This hub is the “source of truth” for my curriculum, weekly build log, projects, and evaluation standards.

## What I’m building
I’m running a 7-course, graduate-level applied program with a simple rule: **ship something real every week** (a demo, a benchmark, a write-up, an evaluation, a design doc, or a tool).

The program focuses on high-stakes domains where the data is ambiguous, the workflow is messy, and the human consequences matter.

## Navigate
- **Roadmap**: the big picture and milestones
- **Syllabus**: each course (12 weeks) with objectives, readings, and assignments
- **Week-by-week**: build log and deliverables
- **Projects**: PsychSync, MedPal, benchmarks, and capstones
- **Ethics & Safety**: what I will and will not do, data handling, disclaimers
- **Validation**: reproducibility + evaluation standards
