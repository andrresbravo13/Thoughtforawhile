# Start Here

Thought for a while is a public, self-directed, graduate-level applied program at the intersection of:
- AI in healthcare (high-stakes decision support)
- XR + robotics (training and procedural systems)
- drug discovery + longevity
- precision genomics
- multi-agent systems and orchestration
- global medical threats
- neurotechnology / BCI

This hub exists so the work is **auditable**, **reproducible**, and **useful** to others.

## What to do first (Phase 0)
### 1) Read the guardrails
- **Ethics & Safety** (especially Disclaimers + Safety Policy)
- **Data Governance**
- **Biosecurity & Misuse**

### 2) Read the one-page agenda
- **Agenda**: thesis statement + what I’m building + evaluation approach

### 3) Use the weekly operating system
Every week ships at least one artifact:
- a demo (video or runnable notebook)
- a benchmark run + error analysis
- a design doc / architecture diagram
- a stakeholder memo
- a safety case
- a reproducible experiment log

### 4) Follow the roadmap
- The **Roadmap** shows milestones and phase outcomes
- The **Week-by-week** pages are the active build log
