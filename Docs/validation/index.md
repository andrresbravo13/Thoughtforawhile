# Validation

This program treats credibility as something you build with evidence:
- reproducibility
- clear evaluation
- honest limitations
- external feedback

## What’s here
- **Reproducibility**: pinned versions, seeds, experiment logging
- **Evaluation Metrics**: beyond accuracy—calibration, safety, robustness
- **External Feedback**: mentor/peer notes (with permission)
- **Changelog**: what changed, why, and what it affected
